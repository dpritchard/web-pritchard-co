[The Data Science Tool Kit](http://www.datasciencetoolkit.org)   

## UK / Ireland Data

For some analysis of data from these databases see Blight 2009 and references therein.

[The Marine Environmental Data and Information Network](http://www.oceannet.org/ "The Marine Environmental Data and Information Network") (MEDIN)  
> The Marine Environmental Data and Information Network (MEDIN) promotes sharing of, and improved access to, these data. It is an open partnership and its partners represent government departments, research institutions and private companies.  

[The British Oceanographic Data Center](https://www.bodc.ac.uk/ "The British Oceanographic Data Center") (BODC)  
> We deal with biological, chemical, physical and geophysical data, and our databases contain measurements of nearly 22,000 different variables. Many of our staff have direct experience of marine data collection and analysis. They work alongside information technology specialists to ensure that data are documented and stored for current and future use.

[The British Atmospheric Data Centre](http://badc.nerc.ac.uk "The British Atmospheric Data Centre")  
> The role of the BADC is to assist UK atmospheric researchers to locate, access and interpret atmospheric data and to ensure the long-term integrity of atmospheric data produced by NERC projects.

[Marine Institute](http://www.marine.ie/home/aboutus/  "Irelands Marine Institute")  
> The Marine Institute is the national agency responsible for Marine Research, Technology Development and Innovation (RTDI). We seek to assess and realise the economic potential of Ireland's 220 million acre marine resource; promote the sustainable development of marine industry  through strategic funding programmes and essential scientific services; and safeguard our marine environment through research and environmental monitoring.

[EuroSITES][eurosites]
> EuroSITES forms an integrated European network of nine deep-ocean observatories sited in waters off the continental shelf and of greater than 1000m depth, measuring variables from sea surface to sea floor.
