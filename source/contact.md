# Contact

I am based in Dunedin (New Zealand). I am an independent researcher aligned with the [Te Tiaki Mahinga Kai][TMK] partnership. As part of this I work closely with staff and students at the [University of Otago][UoO] and [Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu][TAT]. 

My [research focus](/research) has not changed much since 2014 but my employment status has.  Although I am still funded by the [Coastal People : Southern Skies Centre of Research Excellence][CPSS], I am no longer employed by the University of Otago and cannot access emails sent to my old *@otago.ac.nz* address. 

I am now working to re-establish myself as a contractor under the newly established TMK Research Limited.
