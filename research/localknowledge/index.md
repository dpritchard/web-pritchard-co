This project aims to collate information about marine research conducted
around New Zealand. We aim to provide this information in an accessible
format and span a wide range of information sources.

The current focus is on theses published at the University of Otago and
research conducted in the Otago region. However, the database has been
designed to scale to include more locations and information sources.

~~Currently the only way to access the data is via a [proof-of-concept
map](http://db.pritchard.co/localknowledge/map/).~~

**Note:** Currently (2018-08-08) the map interface is offline. I am working to modernise and clean up the data before making it available again. 

## People

This is a collaborative project between the Departments of
[Chemistry](http://neon.otago.ac.nz/chemistry/), [Marine
Science](http://www.otago.ac.nz/marinescience/) and
[Botany](http://www.botany.otago.ac.nz/) at the [University of
Otago](http://www.otago.ac.nz/). The project is co-ordinated by Dr
Rebecca McLeod (Chemistry), Dr Chris Hepburn (Marine Science) and Daniel
Pritchard (Botany).

We are grateful for the efforts of Jared Fudge who entered much of the
initial data as part of a University of Otago Summer Student Bursary
from December 2009 to February 2010.
